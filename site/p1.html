  <h1>A Stacked Roster: Destined for Success</h1>
  <p>The Eagles rooster boasts some impressive names, especially on offensive,
    who most recently came together for a super bowl run in 2022. A top tier
    quarterback, a great wide reciver, and a historic center are just a few
    players on the current Eagles. Here we will dive into the top players on
    the 2023 Eagles, and their likelyness to return.
  </p>

  <h2>Jalen Hurts</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Born in Houston, Texas on August 7, 1998,
    Jalen Alexander Hurts was destined for greatness.
    His dad was a football coach at the high school Jalen
    would eventually play at, and he got into power lifting.
    In 2015 he went to the University of Alabama where he would
    win the Colledge Football Playoff National Championship,
    which he would eventually followed up with a master's degree at the
    University of Oaklahoma in 2023. Before that, he was drafted
    by the Eagles in 2020, though he wasn't immediatly the starter.
    After a game against the Green Bay Packers, however, this changed,
    and since then he has been the starting quarterback for the Eagles.

  <h3>2023 Stats</h3>
  <p> <ul> <li> Passing Yards: 3,858 </li>
    <li> Rushing Yards: 605 </li>
    <li> Touchdowns: 23 </li>
    <li> Interceptions: 15 </li>
    <li> QBR: 89.1 </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Returning</h3>
  <p>After Hurts signed a five year contract extension
    last season, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
    Right now, the biggest thing is proving that his
    performance in 2023 was a bad year, and that 2022
    is the standard, not that he performed terribly, but
    it was a downgrade.

  <h2>A. J. Brown</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p> On June 30th, 1997, in Starkville, Mississippi,
    the world was introduced to Arthur Juan Brown, or
    A. J. Brown. He woud go on to attend Starkville High
    School where he would play both baseball and football.
    He became the second person to ever play in both Under Armour's
    All-America Football and Baseball games. This success led him
    to commit to the University of Mississippi for both
    baseball and football. He would be drafted by the San Diego
    Padres in 2016, which stopped him from playing baseball for
    the rest of him college career. As a result he focused on football
    where he would end up finding massive success, setting many records
    for his school and the SEC. He ended up skipping his senior year
    and going straight to the 2019 NFL Draft. He was picked in the
    second round by the Tennessee Titans, where he would find immediate
    success, helping take the team to the AFC Championship. He would go
    on to have more moderate success with the Titans until he was traded
    to the Eagles during the 2022 Draft for a first and a third round pick.
    Since then he has been a starting wide reciever for the Eagles.
  </p>
  <h3>2023 Stats</h3>
  <p> <ul> <li> 6 consecutive games with 125 recieving yards (NFL record)
  </li>
  <li>Receptions: 106 </li>
  <li>Yards: 1,456</li>
  <li>Touchdowns: 7 </li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Returning</h3>
  <p>While there were some rumors that Brown might be traded
    or leave the Eagles in some way, he recently shut down
    these rumors, stating, "I love where I'm at, it's simple as that, next question."
    This suggests that he will remain with the Eagles for at least a little longer.
