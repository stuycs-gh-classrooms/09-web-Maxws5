  <h1>A Stacked Roster: Destined for Success</h1>
  <p>The Eagles rooster boasts some impressive names, especially on offensive,
    who most recently came together for a super bowl run in 2022. A top tier
    quarterback, a great wide reciver, and a historic center are just a few
    players on the current Eagles. Here we will dive into the top players on
    the 2023 Eagles, and their likelyness to return.
  </p>

  <h2>Jalen Hurts (Quarterback)</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Born in Houston, Texas on August 7, 1998,
    Jalen Alexander Hurts was destined for greatness.
    His dad was a football coach at the high school Jalen
    would eventually play at, and he got into power lifting.
    In 2015 he went to the University of Alabama where he would
    win the Colledge Football Playoff National Championship,
    which he would eventually followed up with a master's degree at the
    University of Oaklahoma in 2023. Before that, he was drafted
    by the Eagles in 2020, though he wasn't immediatly the starter.
    After a game against the Green Bay Packers, however, this changed,
    and since then he has been the starting quarterback for the Eagles.
  </p>
  <h3>2023 Stats</h3>
  <p> <ul> <li> Passing Yards: 3,858 </li>
    <li> Rushing Yards: 605 </li>
    <li> Touchdowns: 23 </li>
    <li> Interceptions: 15 </li>
    <li> QBR: 89.1 </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Returning</h3>
  <p>After Hurts signed a five year contract extension
    last season, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
    Right now, the biggest thing is proving that his
    performance in 2023 was a bad year, and that 2022
    is the standard, not that he performed terribly, but
    it was a downgrade.
  </p>

  <h2>A. J. Brown (Wide Reciever)</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p> On June 30th, 1997, in Starkville, Mississippi,
    the world was introduced to Arthur Juan Brown, or
    A. J. Brown. He woud go on to attend Starkville High
    School where he would play both baseball and football.
    He became the second person to ever play in both Under Armour's
    All-America Football and Baseball games. This success led him
    to commit to the University of Mississippi for both
    baseball and football. He would be drafted by the San Diego
    Padres in 2016, which stopped him from playing baseball for
    the rest of him college career. As a result he focused on football
    where he would end up finding massive success, setting many records
    for his school and the SEC. He ended up skipping his senior year
    and going straight to the 2019 NFL Draft. He was picked in the
    second round by the Tennessee Titans, where he would find immediate
    success, helping take the team to the AFC Championship. He would go
    on to have more moderate success with the Titans until he was traded
    to the Eagles during the 2022 Draft for a first and a third round pick.
    Since then he has been a starting wide reciever for the Eagles.
  </p>
  <h3>2023 Stats</h3>
  <p> <ul> <li> 6 consecutive games with 125 recieving yards (NFL record)
  </li>
  <li>Receptions: 106 </li>
  <li>Yards: 1,456</li>
  <li>Touchdowns: 7 </li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Returning</h3>
  <p>While there were some rumors that Brown might be traded
    or leave the Eagles in some way, he recently shut down
    these rumors, stating, "I love where I'm at, it's simple as that, next question."
    This suggests that he will remain with the Eagles for at least a little longer.
  </p>

  <h2>DeVonta Smith (Wide Reciever)</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Intrestingly enough, DeVonta Smith happens to share the same
    birthday with the author of this webpage: November 14. Smith
    however, was born 10 years earlier in 1998. Born in Amite City,
    Louisiana, Smith would go on to attend Amite High Magnet School,
    where he would play basketball and football. After playing well
    in high school, he committed to the University of Alabama, where
    he would boom. He helped them win the College Football Playoff
    National Championship twice, with the game winning catch in one
    and an impressive three touchdowns and 215 recieving yards in the
    other. He would also win numerous awards, including the SEC
    Offensive Player of the Year. In the 2021 NFL Draft, he was taken
    by the Eagles tenth overall. He has helped lead them to three straight
    playoff appearances, including a Super Bowl appearance.
  </p>
  <h3>2023 Stats</h3>
  <p> <ul> <li> Receptions: 81 </li>
    <li> Touchdowns: 7 </li>
    <li> Yards: 1,066 </li>
    <li> Longest Reception: 63 Yards </li>
    <li> Average Reception: 13.2 Yards </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Returning</h3>
  <p>While Smith's contract extends through the 2024 season, so
    he will definitely be on the Eagles for that time, after that
    there are a few different options. He could get his fifth year
    on his contract, if the Eagles want, extending his time on the
    Eagles for at least one more season. He could also get a contract
    extension. Either way, he will be playing for the Eagles in 2024.

  <h2>D'Andre Swift (Running Back)</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>On January 14, 1999, D'Andre Swift was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
    the city he would end up playing for. He first attended St. Joseph's
    Preparatory School, and then committed to the University of Georgia
    for football. While in his freshman year he was only the third string
    running back, he would share the first spot during his sophomore year.
    After only playing three years of football at Georgia, he declared for
    the 2020 NFL Draft. He was drafted in the second round by the Detroit
    Lions, and after okay statistics in three years with them, he was
    traded to the Eagles in the 2023 NFL Draft for a 2025 fourth round
    pick and swapped 2023 seventh-round picks. His first season with the
    Eagles held massive success that cumulated to a Pro Bowl appearance.
  </p>
  <h3>2023 Stats</h3>
  <p> <ul> <li> Rushing Yards: 1,049 </li>
    <li> Recieving Yards: 214 </li>
    <li> Rushing Touchdowns: 5 </li>
    <li> Recieving Touchdowns: 1 </li>
    <li> Longest Rush: 43 yards </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Returning</h3>
  <p>Though he had a productive and successful 2023 season, Swift does head
    into free angency this year. While the Eagles could resign him, they haven't
    confirmed anything yet. While this author would love to see him back,
    the Eagles let one Pro Bowler leave in 2022 (Miles Sanders), and they
    could easily do the same with Swift.
