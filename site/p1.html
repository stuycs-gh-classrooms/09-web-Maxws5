  <h1>A Stacked Roster: Destined for Success</h1>
  <p>The Eagles rooster boasts some impressive names, especially on offensive,
    who most recently came together for a super bowl run in 2022. A top tier
    quarterback, a great wide reciver, and a historic center are just a few
    players on the current Eagles. Here we will dive into the top players on
    the 2023 Eagles, and their likelyness to return.

  <h2>Jalen Hurts</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Born in Houston, Texas on August 7, 1998,
    Jalen Alexander Hurts was destined for greatness.
    His dad was a football coach at the high school Jalen
    would eventually play at, and he got into power lifting.
    In 2015 he went to the University of Alabama where he would
    win the Colledge Football Playoff National Championship,
    which he would eventually followed up with a master's degree at the
    University of Oaklahoma in 2023. Before that, he was drafted
    by the Eagles in 2020, though he wasn't immediatly the starter.
    After a game against the Green Bay Packers, however, this changed,
    and since then he has been the starting quarterback for the Eagles.

  <h3>2023 Stats</h3>
  <p> <ul> <li> Passing Yards: 3,858 </li>
    <li> Rushing Yards: 605 </li>
    <li> Touchdowns: 23 </li>
    <li> Interceptions: 15 </li>
    <li> QBR: 89.1 </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Returning</h3>
  <p>Hurts signed a five year contract extension
    last season, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
    Right now, the biggest thing is proving that his
    performance in 2023 was a bad year, and that 2022
    is the standard, not that he performed terribly, but
    it was a downgrade.
