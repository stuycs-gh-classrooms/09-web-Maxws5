<h1> History </h1>
<h2> Beginnings </h2>
<p>Before the Eagles, there were the Yellow Jackets, who went
  out of buisness in the middle of the 1931 NFL season. Philadelphia
  offered a lof of money in terms of fanbases. For this reason the
  NFL wanted another team to replace the Yellow Jackets. After searching
  for a while, the NFL settled on Bert Bell and Lud Wray to start a new
  Philly franchise. They decided to call the new team the Eagles after
  the logo of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration">
  National Recovery Administration,</a> which was a part of the New Deal.
  The team originally struggled, not having more than four wins for ten
  seasons.
</p>
<h2> Draft </h2>
<p>After struggling for a long time, Bell, the owner of the Eagles,
  thought of an idea for a college draft. He thought that it would make
  talent more spread out across the league, making more teams competitive.
  This also came after 8 years where 3 teams won all, but one, of the
  championships. While this was a great idea, it didn't help the Eagles,
  who, after money problems, went up for public auction. They then followed
  this with a 1-11 season.
</p>
<h2> Merger </h2>
<p>When World War Two broke out, it became hard to find players for the
  NFL. To deal with this, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles
  combined to become the Phil-Pitt Eagles, though they were commonly
  reffered to as the "Steagles." They went 5-4-1 for the one season they
  existed, 1943.
</p>
<h2> Turning it Around </h2>
<p>In 1944, with Greasy Neale as the head coach, and a star running
  back (Steve Van Buren), the Eagles went positive for the first time
  winning more games than they lost. This success carried to an apperance
  in the NFL Championship Game in 1947, though they lost this game. They
  didn't let this stop them, though, and the next year they came back and
  won the game with home field advantage. In 1949 they came back and won it
  again.
</p>
<h2> Back to Mediocraty </h2>
<p>After back to back championships, the Eagles followed it up with a 6-6
  season. This would be the trend in the 1950's, as they weren't able to
  get the same success as they did in 1947, 1948, and 1949. Then in 1959,
  the Eagles started to show more potential, as they aquired more talent.
  This culminated in a 1960 season that saw numerous players on their last
  season win a NFL Championship. To win it they had to beat Vince Lombardi
  in his only championship loss.
</p>
<h2> Merger 2.0 </h2>
<p> The Eagles didn't produce anything noteworthy for the rest of the
  Pre-Super Bowl era. Then, in 1970, the NFL combined with the AFL,
  keeping the name of National Football League. This put the Eagles in
  the NFC East Division with the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins
  (later renamed to Commanders), and Dallas Cowboys. While the Eagles
  already had a long rivalry with the Giant, this merger sparked a new
  rival for the Eagles: the Cowboys. This rearrangement didn't mean more
  success for the Eagles, however, who continued to produce losing seasons.
</p>
<h2> Turning it Around 2.0 </h2>
<p> In 1977 the Eagles first started getting more hope that maybe something
  could chnage, with a better QB being obtained from a trade with the LA Rams.
  1978 would continue this trend with not only a 9-7 record earning the Eagles
  a playoff apperance, but a moment for the history books when the Eagles beat
  the Giants from a fumble by the Giants that was returned by the Eagles
  for a touchdown in the last 20 seconds. 1979 went even better, with the Eagles
  ending with a 11-5 record and another playoff apperance. This culminated in
  a 1980 NFC Championship game against who else but the rival Cowboys. The
  Eagles won 20-7, sending the Eagles to their first super bowl. This was
  when luck ran out for the Eagles however, as even though they were favored,
  they could not beat the Oakland Raiders, who ended up winning 27-10. The
  next year the Eagles hoped to complete the goal, but, after a 10-6 season,
  lost to the Giants in the wild-card round. This would mark the end of this
  era in Eagles history, as they would go on to finish the 1982 season 3-6.
</p>
<h2> 1983-1994 </h2>
<p> Yeah, some stuff happened. They were good, they were bad. Nothing to note.
</p>
<h2> The 1994 Rebot </h2>
<p> With the current owner of the Eagles being unpopular, he sold the team
  to Jeffrey Lurie. This didn't mean instant success, though, as the Eagles
  missed the playoffs in 1994. The next year the Eagles made the playoffs
  and won one game, but then fell to the Cowboys in the Divisonal Round
  again. A major change happened in 1996, as the uniforms were switched from
  their Kelly Green style to midnight green. With this came a logo switch
  to the curretly used Eagle head. Agai, this didn't mean success, and the
  Eagles sturggled until a head coach change in 1999.
</p>
<h2> Andy Reid </h2>
<p> With a lack of success and fan frustration, the franchise decided
  it was time for a new head coach. As a result they brought in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid">Andy Reid.</a>
  While Reid didn't find immediate success, good drafting and slow
  rebuilding would make the team see success in the 2000's. In 2000 the
  team made the playoffs and won a wild card game, only to then lose to
  the Giants in the Divisonal round. In 2001 they got a 11-5 record,
  again winning a wild card game. They then also won in the Divisional
  Round against the Chicago Bears, but were defeated by the Rams in the
  NFC Championship. In 2002 they again did well, going 12-4, and again
  making it to the NFC Championship, only to lose to the Bucs. In 2003
  the Eagles repeated this again, going 12-4 only to lose in the NFC
  Championship game. In 2004 the Eagles were more dominant than ever,
  clinching the NFC East after only 11 games. After 14 games they had
  clinched the number one seed and were able to sit their starters for
  their last two games, making their final record 13-3. They also were
  able to get over the hump, winning the NFC Championship game and going
  to Super Bowl XXXIX. Here, however, they were outplayed by the Tom Brady
  led Patriots and lost in a 24-21 nail-biter.
</p>
<h2> Small Steps Back </h2>
<p> After their Super Bowl apperance, the Eagles were unable to replicate
  that level of success for a while, going 6-10 in 2005. In 2006 the Eagles
  went 10-6 even after losing their starting QB, but lost in the Divisional
  Round. In 2007 they mised the playoffs again, going 8-8. In 2008 they made
  a surprising run, going 9-6-1 to sneak into the playoffs. They then upset the
  Vikings in the Wild-card round, upset the Giants in the Divisional, and then
  lost to the Cardinals in the NFC Championship. In 2009 they again snuck into
  the playoffs with a 11-5 record, only to lose to their rival Cowboys. In 2010,
  despite an impressive punt return to beat the Giants in Week 15, and a record
  of 10-6, the Eagles lost in the wild-card round again. Then in 2011, despite
  a lot of hype an high profile players being signed, the team only went 8-8.
  In 2012 the team lost eight in a row, eventually leading to the firing of Andy
  Reid.
</p>
<h2> Nothing </h2>
<p> Nothing happened between 2013 and 2015. </p>
<h2> Dougie Days </h2>
<p> On January 18, 2016, history was set in motion with the Eagles signing
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Pederson"> Doug Pederson </a>
  as their new head coach. They followed this up with a lot of complicated
  trades that turned the 13th overall pick in the 2016 Draft to the 2nd
  overall pick. They used this to get QB Carson Wentz, who would immediatly
  be the starter. While the Eagles went 7-9 in 2016, 2017 was what mattered.
  The Eagles looked strong going into a week 14 game against the LA Rams,
  however in the middle of the game their star QB, Carson Wents, was taken
  off the field injured. He was later ruled out for the rest of the season.
  To replace him the Eagles brought in Nick Foles, who no one had any expectations
  for. Though they were able to get home field advantage, skepticism was high
  for the replacement QB. Despite this the Eagles beat the Falcons in the
  Divisional Round. Going into the NFC Championship, the Eagles were favored to
  lose to the Vikings, yet they crushed the vikings 38-7. They were feeling good
  going into the Super Bowl, but were going against the same team that had
  defeated them in the Super Bowl just a few years before. The game ended up being
  exciting with many great plays and the most yards in any game ever. Watch the highlights
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW1xbhW2PEE">here.</a> In the end,
  Nick Foles and the Eagles pulled off the miracle, and got Philly their first
  Super Bowl win ever.
</p>
<h2> Hangover </h2>
<p> After the Eagles Super Bowl win they would go on to have two back to back
  nail biting seasons, ending 9-7 in both and just making the playoffs. In the
  first they had to win five of their last six games and in the second they won
  their last four games to squeak into the playoffs. Neither playoff apperance
  went extremely well, losing in the Divisional and Wild-Card rounds respectively.
  It was now 2020, and the hangover hit hard as the Eagles didn't even make the
  playoffs. This, combined with other factors, led the team to fire Pederson and
  hire Nick Sirianni. They also traded Carson Wentz and instilled Jalen Hurts as the starter.
</p>
<h2> Another Run At It </h2>
<p> With a new head coach, a new QB, and some new start power, especially in DeVonta
  Smith. They used this power to clinch a playoff berth, though they ended up only
  losing in the Wild-Card round. The next year, however, the Eagles came back better than
  ever. They started with eight straight wins, and eventually got the number one seed.
  They used this to get back into the Super Bowl. Here, however, they were again
  unable to complete. While the game was extremley close, a terrible holding call at the
  end made it a win for Kansas City. The next year, 2023, the Eagles started extremely
  well, 10-1, and were expected to do great. They followed this up, however, with a 1-5
  end to the season which was ended with a sad Wild-Card loss to the Bucs. This offseason
  the Eagles have a lot of potantial. The question is can they make another run,
  or fall back into mediocraty.
