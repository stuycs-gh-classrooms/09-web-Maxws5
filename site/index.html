  <h1> TIME </h1>
  <h2> Yes, it's big </h2>
  <p> Sometimes you just have to get writing. Thinking is secondary, writing is primary. Work, work, work </p>
  <h2> STOP </h2>
  <p> Words on a page. Thats all this is. All of the words exist simultaneously. None of the code occurs
    after the other. The letters are displayed in the same use of light, or lack thereof, with no prioritization.
    And yet time exists. You read <b> this word </b> before <i> this one. </i> A story can be told. And one will be.
  </p>
  <p> Don't worry, there is an overarching theme, one that will be stuck to quite tightly: Time. Yes it's big, but
    the only thing limiting us is the subject matter itself. So lets get started.
