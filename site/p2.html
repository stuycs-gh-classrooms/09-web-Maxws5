  <h1>Jerseys</h1>

<img class="center" src="images/all_uniforms.gif" height="900px">

  <p>Over the years, the Philidelphia Eagles have sported many different outfits
    when playing. Here, however, we will only focus on the four main ones worn
    in the 2023 season. This doesn't come without excitment, though, as in 2023
    the Eagles wore a new uniform in two weeks, against the Miami Dolphins and
    the Buffalo Bills. Without further ado, the outfits.
  </p>

  <h2>Color</h2>

<img class="floater-l" src="images/color_uniform.jpg" height="300px">

  <h3>Info</h3>
  <p>While many different outfits have suited the Eagles over time,
    right now midnight green is the main color of the Eagles.
    Their color uniforms, usually worn for home games (though also in Dallas
    due to the Cowboys wearing white at home), consist of midnight green
    tops with white letters for the names and white numbers. On the shoulders
    are the logo of the Eagles and the players numbers in white. The pants
    contrast this, being fully white. The helmets, which are the same as the
    white outfit's helmets, are midnight green with wings in silver on the
    front outlined in black.

  <h2>White</h2>

<img class="floater-l" src="images/white_uniform.jpg" height="300px">

  <h3>Info</h3>
  <p>A standard of most NFL teams, the white uniforms of the Eagles are
    worn on most away games (except the aforementioned Cowboys). They
    are pretty much the complete inverse of the colored outfits, with
    the shirts being white with midnight green lettering, and the pants
    being midnight green to contrast. It should be noted that the pants
    are more loose to this uniform, with the pants sometimes being white
    or even balck. The helmets are completely the sames the colored outfit.

  <h2>Black on Black</h2>

<img class="floater-l" src="images/black_uniform.webp" height="300px">

  <h3>Info</h3>
  <p>Due to NFL regulations, teams are allowed to wear alternative uniforms
    three times a year. One of the alternative uniforms in the Eagles
    rotation is the Black on Black uniform. This is a full uniform with
    white lettering and touches of midnight green. The helmets are the
    same as the other uniforms due to the fact that teams are only allowed
    to have two different helmets, which the Eagles use on their regular
    and Kelly Green helmets, though in the past the Black on Black uniforms
    also had a balck helmet. While these uniforms used to be worn a lot, they
    are expected to see less playtime as the Kelly Green uniforms have become
    the primary alternative uniform of the Eagles. There are rumors, however,
    that the Eagles will wear these uniforms every Christmas as they have done
    so for the past two years.

  <h2>Kelly Green</h2>

<img class="floater-l" src="images/kelly_uniform.jpg" height="300px">

  <h3>Info</h3>
  <p>Introduced in the 2023 season, the Kelly Green uniforms were an instant
    hit. They are a throwback to the previous uniforms used by the Eagles
    before a switch in 1996 made midnight green the main color. They consist
    of Kelly Green shirts with white lettering for the name and number in
    a different font than the usual uniforms. The logo on the shoulders
    switches from the current Eagles logo to the previous one before 1996,
    which is a full eagle holding a football, not just the head of an eagle.
    The pants are grey and the socks have two kelly green stripes on them.
    The helmets also switch up, with the primary color being kelly green and
    the wings on them not being as detailed, another feature of the uniform
    before 1996.
