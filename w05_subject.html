    <h2>Last year</h2>
    <p>
      It was a hard year. We started off strong, but then we fell down. For now all
      we can do is mourn and hope it gets better. Most importantly, make sure to
      stand strong behing Swift, Smith, A.J. Brown, and our King, Hurts. Here is
      the link to a therapists office, if any of you need support.

    <h2>The rules<h2>
      <h3>Throwing</h3>
      <p>
        To throw the ball, one needs to bring back their arm, then begin to
        bring it forward such that the ball leaves their hand, and then goes
        forward in a spiral motion. This should be aimed at an eligible reciever.

      <h3>Catching</h3>
      <p>
        When someone throws the ball, you should be there to catch it. This would
        create the dicotamy which would then induce you recieving the ball. Per chance
        you must extend your arms then getting this ball

      <h3>GOATS</h3>
      <p>
        When there is a goat, you must hate them. This is a rule.

    <h2>looking forward</h2>
    <p>
      We have a new OC and a new DC and we have the best quaterback ever, a great wide reciever core, and a great running back.
      If we draft good defense, then super bowl here we come.
